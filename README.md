I'm *Nabeel Farooqui*, probably the first time you ever heard this name and i hope you pronounced it well. 

Skipping the rest, _Art_ is my passion, i like to sketch or paint whatever idea comes into my mind. Sometimes i write, although not very good at it. I like designing and making stuff too. I'll drop some of my artworks down below -->

Music is one of my hobbies, i enjoy singing, some of the music instruments that i find interesting are - Guitar, Drums and Bass. I kinda listen to all kinds of music but i hate kpop, and i hope you do too. Some of my favourite genres are - RnB and Soul, Metal, Progressive Metal, Hip Hop and Folk. I like anime too, always end up binge watching.

Guess that's enough, thanks for going through it!
